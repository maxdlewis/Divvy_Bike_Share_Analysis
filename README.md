# Coursera Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
## Scenario
I work at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share Chicago based company, as a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team. The director of marketing, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual memberships is the key to the company's growth. My team was assigned the question of "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?" and instructed to design a new marketing strategy based off of this information.

## Business Task
Determine how **annual members** and **casual riders** use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Data
The data I utilized for this project was provided in the capstone project from two datasets, 2019 Q1 Divvy Data and 2020 Q1 Divvy Data. As there were inconsistencies in these datasets, it was necessary to clean the data. This included, but not limited to, removing unnecessary columns, that were irrelevant to the business task, and combining both datasets into one. 

## Key Findings
### 1. Average Ride Length by Rider Type and Day of Week
I found that casual riders take **longer rides** on average, especially on Saturdays and Sundays.
I also found that annual members ride for **shorter, but more consistent durations**, with slight variations depending on the day.
