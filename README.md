# Cyclistic Bike-Shara Analysis
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Analyzing Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 public bike share data for Cyclistic, a fictional company used by Coursera.

## Business Task
Determine how **annual members** and **casual riders** use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Tools Used
**RStudio**: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization
**Tidyverse**, **ggplot2**, **dplyr**
**Tableau**
**Excel**, **Google Sheets**
**GitHub**: version control and portfolio sharing

## Process Overview
For this capstone project, I followed the 6 steps of the data analysis process. 
1. **Ask** The business task is to design a strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. I was assigned the question of how do annual members and casual riders use the bikes differently.
2. **Prepare** I located the 2019 and 2020 ride data and verified its integrity.
3. **Process** Cleaned, filtered, and combined the data into one datasheet using a combination of Excel and RStudio.
4. **Analyze** Compared the average ride duration and total number of rides differenciated by the rider type and day of the week.
5. **Share** Created visualizations to communicate key insights derived from the analyze step.
6. **Act** Suggested data driven recommendations for marketing strategy utilizing the ..........

## Key Findings
### 1. Average Ride Length by Rider Type and Day of Week
Casual riders take **longer rides**, especially on Saturdays and Sundays.
Annual members take **shorter, more consistent rides**, with slight variations depending on the day.
